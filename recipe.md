Step by step method :

1.Whisk the yogurt in a large bowl until smooth. Strain it for several hours until you have thick yogurt left.
2.Add all the ingredients for marinade to the yogurt- ginger garlic paste, mustard oil, coriander powder, chaat masala, garam masala, red chili powder, kasuri methi and salt.
3.Whisk to combine everything together.
4.Add in juice of 1 lemon along with chopped cilantro and mint. Mix well.
5.Stir in the paneer cubes, onion and bell peppers.
6.Mix until all the paneer pieces and vegetables are well coated with the marinade. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for minimum for 1 hour or up to 4 hours.
7.After 1-2 hours, take the marinated paneer and vegetables out of the refrigerator. Take a skewer and arrange paneer, onion and peppers on a skewer, alternating with each other. Make all skewers similarly. Meanwhile pre-heat oven to 450 F degrees. Make sure you pre-heat the oven for good 15-20 minutes.
8.Arrange all the prepared skewers on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Spray the tikka with a oil spray. This is important so that the vegetables don’t dry out. Bake at 450 F degrees for 10 minutes and then turn on the broil. Broil for 2 to 3 minutes until paneer pieces look little charred. 
9.Remove from oven, squeeze lemon juice, sprinkle chaat masala and serve with cilantro chutney. If you want the paneer to be even softer, bake at 450 F degrees for 5 minutes and then broil for 3 to 4 minutes. Don’t overcook the paneer else it will gets really tough and chewy, you want it soft.
